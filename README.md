# 🧠 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Lab Record

This repository contains all my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** lab programs written in **C**.  
Each program is implemented from scratch and focuses on understanding how data structures actually work internally — rather than just using built-in features.

---

## 📘 Overview

All programs were developed as part of the **DSA Lab sessions** under the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering (Artificial Intelligence and Data Science)** at **SCSVMV University**.  
These experiments cover fundamental to intermediate concepts such as searching, stacks, queues, string manipulation, and linked lists.
