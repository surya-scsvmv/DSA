# 🧠 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Lab Record

This repository contains all my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** lab programs written in **C**, implemented from scratch to understand how each data structure works internally.

---

## 📘 Overview

These programs were developed as part of the **DSA Laboratory** under the  
**Department of Computer Science and Engineering (Artificial Intelligence and Data Science)** at **SCSVMV University**.

The record covers essential concepts such as searching, stacks, queues, string operations, linked lists, tree traversals, and sorting algorithms.
