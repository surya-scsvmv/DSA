# 🧠 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Lab Record

This repository contains all my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** lab programs written in **C**, implemented from scratch to understand how core data structures work internally.

---

## 📘 Overview

All programs were developed as part of the **DSA Laboratory** under the  
**Department of Computer Science and Engineering (Artificial Intelligence and Data Science)** at **SCSVMV University**.

The experiments cover essential concepts such as searching, stacks, queues, string processing, singly linked lists, and doubly linked lists.
