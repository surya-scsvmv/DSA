# 🧠 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Lab Record

This repository contains all my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** lab programs written in **C**.  
Each experiment is implemented from scratch and focuses on understanding how different data structures actually work under the hood.

---

## 📘 Overview

All programs were done as part of my **DSA Lab sessions**, covering basic to intermediate data structure concepts — arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, and expression conversions.

| 1 | **LinearSearch** | Searches for an element sequentially in an array |
| 2 | **BinarySearch** | Searches for an element using divide-and-conquer |
| 3 | **StackPush** | Performs stack push operation using arrays |
| 4 | **StackPop** | Performs stack pop operation from a stack |
| 5 | **Infix-Postfix** | Converts an infix expression into postfix form |
| 6 | **LinkedList-Insertion-at-End** | Inserts a new node at the end of a linked list |
| 7 | **SimpleQueue** | Basic queue implementation using arrays |
| 8 | **StringReversal** | Reverses a string using stack operations |
