# 🧠 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Lab Record

This repository contains all my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** lab programs written in **C**.  
Each program is implemented from scratch and focuses on understanding how data structures actually work internally — rather than just using built-in features.

---

## 📘 Overview

All programs were developed as part of the **DSA Lab sessions**, covering fundamental to intermediate topics like searching, stacks, queues, string manipulation, and linked lists.
